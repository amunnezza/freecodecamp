<!-- applied visual Design
Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges
Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography,
color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's
message.
The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.

At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information.
The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's
experience.
In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content,
and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.

This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own
visual designs.-->

<!-- Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design.
The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a
number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to
align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the
left and right edges of the line box.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

Align the h4 tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the
paragraph tag which contains information about how Google was founded.

Your code should use the text-align property on the h4 tag to set it to center.
Your code should use the text-align property on the p tag to set it to justify.
-->
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align:center;
  }
  p {
    text-align:justify;
  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;
  }
  -----
  </style>

  <!-- Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property
You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS.
Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units
(such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element.
Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

img {
  width: 220px;
}
Add a width property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px.
Use the fullCard class to select the element.

Your code should change the width property of the card to 245 pixels by using
the fullCard class selector.-->

<!-- Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element
The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
blur-radius,
spread-radius and
color, in that order.
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of
each box-shadow element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur,
at mostly-transparent black colors:

box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
The element now has an id of thumbnail. With this selector, use the example CSS
 values above to place a box-shadow on the card.

Your code should add a box-shadow property for the thumbnail id.
You should use the given CSS for the box-shadow value.-->

#thumbnail {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
}


  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard" id="thumbnail">
  <div class="cardContent">
    ....
    <!-- Decrease the Opacity of an Element
The opacity property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely,
the transparency for an item.

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.
The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with
 some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.

Set the opacity of the anchor tags to 0.7 using links class to select them.

Your code should set the opacity property to 0.7 on the anchor tags by selecting
the class of links.
-->
.links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
    opacity: 0.7

  }

  <!-- Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase
The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text.
It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently,
without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the
example text "Transform me".

Value	          Result
lowercase	      "transform me"
uppercase	      "TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	    "Transform Me"
initial	        Use the default value
inherit	        Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none          	Default: Use the original text


Transform the text of the h4 to be uppercase using the text-transform property.

The h4 text should be uppercase.
The original text of the h4 should not be changed. -->
h4 {
   text-align: center;
   background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
   padding: 10px;
   font-size: 27px;
   text-transform: uppercase;

 }

 <!-- Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements
The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given
element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency
of text on a page.
In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance
the heading sizes.

Set the font-size of the h1 tag to 68px.
Set the font-size of the h2 tag to 52px.
Set the font-size of the h3 tag to 40px.
Set the font-size of the h4 tag to 32px.
Set the font-size of the h5 tag to 21px.
Set the font-size of the h6 tag to 14px.

Your code should set the font-size property for the h1 tag to 68 pixels.
Your code should set the font-size property for the h2 tag to 52 pixels.
Your code should set the font-size property for the h3 tag to 40 pixels.
Your code should set the font-size property for the h4 tag to 32 pixels.
Your code should set the font-size property for the h5 tag to 21 pixels.
Your code should set the font-size property for the h6 tag to 14 pixels.-->

<style>
h1{
  font-size: 68px;
}
h2{
  font-size: 52px;
}
h3{
  font-size: 40 ;
}
h4{
  font-size: 32 ;
}
h5{
  font-size: 21;
}
h6{
  font-size: 14;
}
</style>
<h1>This is h1 text</h1>
<h2>This is h2 text</h2>
<h3>This is h3 text</h3>
<h4>This is h4 text</h4>
<h5>This is h5 text</h5>
<h6>This is h6 text</h6>

<!-- Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements
You set the font-size of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the font-weight.

The font-weight property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

Set the font-weight of the h1 tag to 800.
Set the font-weight of the h2 tag to 600.
Set the font-weight of the h3 tag to 500.
Set the font-weight of the h4 tag to 400.
Set the font-weight of the h5 tag to 300.
Set the font-weight of the h6 tag to 200.
-->

<style>
  h1 {
    font-size: 68px;
    font-weight: 800;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 52px;
    font-weight: 600 ;
  }
  h3 {
    font-size: 40px;
font-weight: 500 ;
  }
  h4 {
    font-size: 32px;
font-weight: 400;
  }
  h5 {
    font-size: 21px;
  font-weight: 300;
  }
  h6 {
    font-size: 14px;
font-weight: 200;
  }
</style>
<h1>This is h1 text</h1>
<h2>This is h2 text</h2>
<h3>This is h3 text</h3>
<h4>This is h4 text</h4>
<h5>This is h5 text</h5>
<h6>This is h6 text</h6>

<!-- Set the font-size of Paragraph Text
The font-size property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to
 any element containing text.
Change the value of the font-size property for the paragraph to 16px to make it
more visible.
Set the line-height of Paragraphs
CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block
 of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.
Add a line-height property to the p tag and set it to 25px.-->

<style>
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height:25px;
  }
</style>
<p>

<!-- Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag
This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes.
A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select
a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state
using the :hover pseudo-class selector.
Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}
The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule so that
when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue.

The anchor tag color should remain black, only add CSS rules for the :hover state.
The anchor tag should have a color of blue on hover.-->
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }
  a:hover{
    color:blue;
  }



</style>

<!-- Change an Element's Relative Position
CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as
the CSS Box Model.
Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs,
 and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans).
 The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document,
 but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how
CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page.
It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom.
These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where
it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels
away from the bottom:

p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}
Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal
flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default
position. Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the
visual layout of a page.
It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying
HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom.
This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like
screen readers) access your content.

Change the position of the h2 to relative, and use a CSS offset to move it 15
pixels away from the top of where it sits in the normal flow.
Notice there is no impact on the positions of the surrounding h1 and p elements.

The h2 element should have a position property set to relative.
Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the h2 15px away from
the top of where it normally sits. -->

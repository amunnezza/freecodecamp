<!-- Introduction to Basic CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other
content that you write in HTML.

Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

color
fonts
positioning
spacing
sizing
decorations
transitions
There are three main ways to apply CSS styling.
You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute.
Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document.
Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference
that file in the HTML document.
Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer
external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML
elements.
This improves the readability and reusability of your code.

The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element
in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to
that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.

In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your
CatPhotoApp can change it from simple text to something more.

Note: Some browser extensions may interfere with elements on the page.
If the tests fail, try disabling your extensions for the most
reliable experience.-->

<!--  Basic CSS: Change the Color of Text
Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.

The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the
color style property.

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:

<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; .

Change your h2 element's style so that its text color is red.

Your h2 element should have a style declaration.
Your h2 element should have color set to red.
Your style declaration should end with a ; . -->
<h2 style="color:red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements
With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the
way an element looks on your page.

When you entered <h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were styling that
individual h2 element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to
apply CSS.

At the top of your code, create a style block like this:

<style>
</style>
Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements.
For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule
that looks like this:

<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and })
 around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your
 element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags.
 Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's
 style rules.

Delete your h2 element's style attribute, and instead create a CSS style block.
Add the necessary CSS to turn all h2 elements blue.

The style attribute should be removed from your h2 element.
You should create a style element.
Your h2 element should be blue.
Your stylesheet h2 declaration should be valid with a semicolon and closing brace.
All your style elements should be valid and have closing tags.-->
<style>
h2 {
  color:blue;
}
</style>

<!-- Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style>
tag.
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your
HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.

Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update
the color's value from blue to red.

Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of 'red-text'.

Your h2 element should be red.
Your h2 element should have the class red-text.
Your stylesheet should declare a red-text class and have its color set to red.
You should not use inline style declarations like style="color: red" in your
h2 element.-->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements.
You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p element.

Your h2 element should be red.
Your h2 element should have the class red-text.
Your first p element should be red.
Your second and third p elements should not be red.
Your first p element should have the class red-text.-->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class='red-text'>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

<!--Change the Font Size of an Element
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:

h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
Inside the same <style> tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry
for p elements and set the font-size to 16 pixels (16px).

Between the style tags, give the p elements font-size of 16px.
Browser and Text zoom should be at 100%. -->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>

<!-- Set the Font Family of an Element
You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.

For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to sans-serif, you
would use the following CSS:

h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
Make all of your p elements use the monospace font.

Your p elements should use the font monospace.-->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>
<!-- Import a Google Font
In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems,
we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website.
There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet.
For this example we will focus on the Google Fonts library.

Google Fonts is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by
referencing the font's URL.

So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is
blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).

To import a Google Font, you can copy the font(s) URL from the Google Fonts
library and then paste it in your HTML.
For this challenge, we'll import the Lobster font.
To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your
code editor (before the opening style element):

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the
FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;.

The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other
specified font is not available. This is covered in the next challenge.

Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a
space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font,
but not to use the Lobster font.

Create a font-family CSS rule that uses the Lobster font, and ensure that it
will be applied to your h2 element.

You should import the Lobster font.
Your h2 element should use the font Lobster.
You should use an h2 CSS selector to change the font.
Your p element should still use the font monospace.-->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  h2{
    font-family:Lobster;
  }
</style>
<!-- Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers.
These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another
font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but degrade to
the sans-serif font when Helvetica isn't available, you will specify it as
follows:

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes
because they are CSS keywords.

To begin, apply the monospace font to the h2 element, so that it now has two
fonts - Lobster and monospace.

In the last challenge, you imported the Lobster font using the link tag.
Now comment out that import of the Lobster font (using the HTML comments you
learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore.
Notice how your h2 element degrades to the monospace font.

Note: If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the
 degradation because your browser is able to find the font.

Your h2 element should use the font Lobster.
Your h2 element should degrade to the font monospace when Lobster is not
available.
You should comment out your call to Google for the Lobster font by putting
<!-- in front of it.
You should close your comment by adding -->.-->
<!--<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }
</style>
<!--  Size Your Images
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use: -->

<style>
  .larger-image {
    width: 500px;
  }
</style>
<!--
Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide.

Note: Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.

Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
Your image should be 100 pixels wide. Browser zoom should be at 100%.-->
  <style>
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px
  }
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>


<!--
  Add Borders Around Your Elements
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element,
we could use this class: -->

<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
<!--
Create a class called thick-green-border.
This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element.
Apply the class to your cat photo.

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class
attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:
<img class="class1 class2">

Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
Your img element should have the class thick-green-border.
Your image should have a border width of 10px.
Your image should have a border style of solid.
The border around your img element should be green. -->

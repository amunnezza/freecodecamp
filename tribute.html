        <p><strong>Albert Einstein </strong> <em>(Ulma 1879 – Princeton 1955)</em> was a theoric physicist. He he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest innovator of the past century. His work were seminal for a great part of the physics study in the XX century as his study on photoelectric effect originating the  <em>quantistic theory of the light</em>, another study given origin to the . His work with his personal life and history made him a prominent figure in the XX century.</p>

            The first job was about the double nature of light and lead to creation of quantistic theory. <br>
            The second work was about the atomic nature of matter.<br>
            The third was the basis of the theory of relaitivity and the famous <span class="formula" >E = mc<sup>2</sup></span> formula was given as conseguence of this last work.

If you are able to do this, the way to a new paradise is open, otherwise the risk of universal death is before you” <span>.    </p>

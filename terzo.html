Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges
Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography,
color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's
message.
The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.

At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information.
The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's
experience.
In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content,
and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.

This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own
visual designs.-->

<!-- Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design.
The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a
number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to
align it with the text-align property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the
left and right edges of the line box.

text-align: center; centers the text

text-align: right; right-aligns the text

And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

Align the h4 tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the
paragraph tag which contains information about how Google was founded.

Your code should use the text-align property on the h4 tag to set it to center.
Your code should use the text-align property on the p tag to set it to justify.
-->
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align:center;
  }
  p {
    text-align:justify;
  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;
  }
  -----
  </style>

  <!-- Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property
You can specify the width of an element using the width property in CSS.
Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units
(such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element.
Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

img {
  width: 220px;
}
Add a width property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px.
Use the fullCard class to select the element.

Your code should change the width property of the card to 245 pixels by using
the fullCard class selector.-->
